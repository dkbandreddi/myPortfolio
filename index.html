                    <p>
                        I am a diligent undergraduate computer science student soon to be graduating in
                        April 2024 with a passion for coding and problem-solving. I am an
                        experienced Web Developer passionate about creating attractive and
                        interactive websites that meet customer needs and exceed
                        expectations. I have a strong foundation in programming languages
                        such as Java and JavaScript, as well as experience with database
                        management and web development. I am always eager to learn new
                        technologies and programming techniques to improve my skills and
                        abilities. Additionally, I am a collaborative team player who is detail-oriented
                        and can think creatively to develop innovative solutions.

                <p>Built a full-fledged website that displays records of
                    plane crashes. The records were taken from a .csv fileand populated into MongoDB. The CRUD functionality allows

                     Existing records
                    can also be updated and deleted per the user's request. Displayed graph for the number of crashes
                    and fatalities for each year.</p>
